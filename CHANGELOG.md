### Added

- Added possibility to add a casing layer (_CasingId_) to an instrument.
- Added new columns in borehole table for LV03 coordinates.
- Added inputs for entering coordinates in LV03 as well as LV95. The coordinates in the coordinate system that were not entered by the user, are automatically transformed and completed.

### Changed

- Migrate existing LV95 coordinates into LV03 coordinates using 'shift' method. Preserve original LV95 coordinates for some selected boreholes (e.g. BÃ¼lach-1-1, ...).

- Order codelists in translation UI by `order` column instead of by `geolcode`.
- Coordinates, elevations diameters and depths in inputs and texts are now displayed with thousand separators.
- Removed `mentions` functionality in workflow comments.
- Removed unused columns from database: `borehole.import_id`, `borehole.tecto_id_cli`, `stratigraphy.import_id`, `layer.import_id`, `layer.tectonic_unit_id_cli`, `layer.symbol_id_cli`, `layer.soil_state_id_cli`, `layer.kirost_id_cli`.
